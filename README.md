# Cab Fare Prediction System 🚖💰

Welcome to the Cab Fare Prediction System repository! This project aims to revolutionize the cab rental industry by leveraging the power of analytics to provide accurate fare predictions for cab rides in cities across the country. 🌐📈

## Introduction 📚

In today's fast-paced world, cab rental services are experiencing exponential growth. With their convenient and flexible offerings, these services provide customers with a remarkable experience at competitive prices. Our startup company has already made successful strides by successfully running a pilot project, and now we're gearing up to launch our cab service nationwide. 🚀

## Problem Statement ❓

As we expand our services across the country, we face the challenge of accurately predicting fare amounts for cab rides. To address this challenge, we have collected extensive historical data from our pilot project. The task at hand involves designing a sophisticated analytics-driven system that can predict the fare amount for cab rides within a city. Our goal is to provide our customers with transparent and reliable fare estimates that enhance their overall experience. 💡💸

## Pre-Processing 🧹

Before diving into building a predictive model, it's crucial to prepare the data through a series of preprocessing steps. These steps collectively fall under Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which involves:

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Uncovering insights about the dataset, identifying potential issues, and addressing them to ensure data quality.

- **Missing Values Treatment:** Dealing with missing values in the dataset by imputing or removing them, ensuring that the data is complete.

- **Outlier Analysis:** Identifying and handling outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset.

- **Feature Selection:** Selecting the most relevant features for modeling to enhance predictive performance and reduce noise.

- **Feature Scaling:** Standardizing or normalizing features to ensure that their values are on a similar scale.

- **Skewness and Log Transformation:** Addressing skewness in the data through log transformation to improve the model's assumptions.

- **Visualization:** Creating graphs and plots to visualize the data's distribution, relationships, and patterns.

## Modelling 🛠️

Once the data has been pre-processed, we transition to the modeling phase. Modeling is a critical step that involves selecting appropriate algorithms to gain meaningful insights from the data. Given our problem statement and dataset, we will experiment with the following models on our preprocessed data:

- **Linear Regression:** A fundamental model used to establish relationships between variables and predict outcomes.

- **Decision Tree:** A tree-based model that makes decisions based on a series of questions.

- **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees that collectively make predictions with improved accuracy.

- **Gradient Boosting:** An ensemble technique that builds multiple models sequentially, each improving upon the mistakes of its predecessor.

### Hyperparameter Tuning 🎯

To optimize the performance of our models, we employ hyperparameter tuning. This involves searching for the best combination of hyperparameters that yield the most accurate predictions. We utilize two techniques for hyperparameter tuning:

- **Random Search CV:** A randomized search over specified hyperparameter ranges to find optimal values efficiently.

- **Grid Search CV:** Exhaustively trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters to identify the best configuration.

### Model Selection 🏆

The final step of our methodology involves the selection of the most suitable model based on a thorough evaluation of different outputs and results produced by the tested models. We consider multiple parameters and metrics to determine which model aligns best with our problem statement and dataset.

By following this comprehensive approach, we aim to create a robust and accurate Cab Fare Prediction System that provides reliable fare estimates to enhance the cab rental experience for our customers.

## Features and Highlights ✨
